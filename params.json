{"name":"OpenStreeMaps Raleigh, NC Data Wrangling With MongoDB","tagline":"OSM data extract of Raleigh Area has been cleaned and loaded into MongoDB instance for analysis","body":"### Background\r\nUsing a [Open Street Maps](https://www.openstreetmap.org) extract of Raleigh, NC from [MapZen])(https://s3.amazonaws.com/metro-extracts.mapzen.com/raleigh_north-carolina.osm.bz2), data munging techniques - such as assessing the quality of the data for validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency and uniformity - were used to clean the OpenStreetMap data and were loaded into a MongoDB instance. MongoDB queries were then run to analyze the data. The data validation and audit was performed in Python. The code and other extracts can be downloaded using the 'Download .zip' link above.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWeâ€™ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Author\r\nThe above project was done as part of the 'Data Analayst Nanodegree' by Roshan Shetty.
